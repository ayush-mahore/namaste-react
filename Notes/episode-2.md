# Episode 2 - Iginiting out app

## -> First thing we do is to connect our code to a github repo and push all of it on it.

## -> To make our app production ready we need to do the following tasks -

 - Task 1 -> Minify our file(Remove console logs and budle things up.)

- Task 2 -> Need a server to run things.

 ## -> The process looks something like this 

 Minify  --> Optimization --> Clean console --> Bundle
